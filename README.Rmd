# debugin

Developpers debug. A lot. One way to do it in R is to wrap your functions in `debug()`, and run it again. And then we have `debug()` it, and need to `undebug()` them. Or we can also call `debugonce()`. 

## Debug functions

Developpers like to be efficient. Writing debug and undebug can break your workflow. So why not doing it with a keyboard shortcut? 

That's what `{debugin}` does: you highlight a function in your RStudio windows, and the addin does the job of `debug()`, `undebug()`, or `debugonce()`.

> Note: using debugin is better with keyboard shortcuts 

The addin allows : 

+ `debug()`
+ `debugonce()`
+ `undebug()`

## Debug with message

You can access the debug_with_messages utils functions: 

```{r}
library(debugin)
a <- function() "plop"
debug_with_message(a)
undebug_with_message(a)
```

Comparing to base function, these functions does nothing more than printing a message to the user. Hence the use of an addin.

## trace_back

With base R, the traceback is printed in reverse order (from the last call to the first). With `trace_back()`, you get the call stack in the order the calls were made. Plus, the first call is printed in blue, and the call causing the error in printed in red (if your R session support ANSI colors).

```{r eval=FALSE}
my_fun <- function(x){
  dplyr::select(x, 1:10)
}
my_fun(1:100)
trace_back()
```
